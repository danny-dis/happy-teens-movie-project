# Movo Core Architecture

This directory contains the core architectural components of the Movo application. The architecture follows a modular approach with clear separation of concerns.

## Directory Structure

- `adapters/`: Adapters for external services and APIs
- `domain/`: Domain models and business logic
- `infrastructure/`: Infrastructure services (logging, analytics, etc.)
- `presentation/`: Presentation logic (view models, presenters)
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers

## Architecture Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a specific responsibility
2. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each class/module has a single responsibility
4. **Interface Segregation**: Clients should not depend on interfaces they don't use
5. **Dependency Injection**: Dependencies are injected rather than created

## Usage Guidelines

- Domain logic should be independent of UI frameworks
- Infrastructure services should be abstracted behind interfaces
- Presentation logic should be separated from UI components
- Adapters should handle all external communication

## Benefits

- Improved testability
- Enhanced maintainability
- Better code organization
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Simplified refactoring
