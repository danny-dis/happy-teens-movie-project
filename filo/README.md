Filo is a revolutionary, fully decentralized streaming platform that operates with absolutely no central servers. All content is shared directly between users in a peer-to-peer network, creating a resilient, censorship-resistant platform for media sharing and consumption.

## 🌟 Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **100% Decentralized**: No central servers - all functionality is peer-to-peer
- **Local-First Architecture**: Works offline with seamless online synchronization
- **Multi-Protocol P2P**: Uses WebTorrent, IPFS, and custom protocols for maximum resilience
- **Cryptographic Identity**: Self-sovereign identity with no central authentication
- **Distributed Content Index**: Find content without relying on central databases
- **Community Moderation**: Decentralized content moderation through reputation and consensus

### Advanced P2P Capabilities
- **Multi-Source Streaming**: Stream content from multiple peers simultaneously
- **Adaptive Quality**: Automatically adjust quality based on available peer bandwidth
- **Content Verification**: Cryptographic verification ensures content integrity
- **Distributed Redundancy**: Content is automatically replicated across the network
- **Geographic Optimization**: Connect to nearby peers for lower latency
- **Incentivized Participation**: Token system rewards content sharing and network participation
- **Mesh Network Support**: Allow content sharing over local mesh networks when internet is unavailable
- **Decentralized Computation**: Distribute intensive processing tasks across the peer network

### User Experience
- **Intuitive Interface**: Beautiful, responsive design that works across devices
- **Offline-First**: Full functionality even without internet connection
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core features work in all browsers, advanced features in modern ones
- **Privacy Controls**: Fine-grained control over what you share and with whom
- **Personal Library**: Organize and manage your downloaded content
- **Content Discovery**: Find new content through distributed recommendation system

### Experimental Features
- **Federated Learning**: Train recommendation models across the network without sharing personal data
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Perform operations on encrypted data without decrypting it
- **Light Field Video**: Support for volumetric video that allows changing perspective after recording
- **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: Future-proof security against quantum computing attacks
- **Neural Rendering**: AI-enhanced upscaling and frame interpolation for smoother playback

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Modern web browser with WebRTC support

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zophlic/happy-teens-movie-project.git
cd happy-teens-movie-project/filo
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

## 🔧 Architecture

Filo is built on a completely decentralized architecture:

### Core Components

1. **Decentralized Identity**: Self-sovereign identity using cryptographic keys
2. **Distributed Content Index**: Find content without central servers using DHT
3. **Multi-Protocol Content Distribution**: Share content via WebTorrent, IPFS, and direct WebRTC
4. **Local-First Storage**: Store content and metadata locally with network sync
5. **Distributed Moderation**: Community-based content moderation through reputation and consensus
6. **Incentive System**: Token-based rewards for network participation

### Data Flow

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Peer A    │◄────┤    DHT      │────►│   Peer C    │
│  (Seeder)   │     │   Network   │     │  (Leecher)  │
└──────┬──────┘     └─────────────┘     └──────▲──────┘
       │                                        │
       │           ┌─────────────┐              │
       └──────────►│   Peer B    │──────────────┘
                   │  (Seeder)   │
                   └─────────────┘
```

## 🔒 Privacy and Security

Filo prioritizes user privacy and content security:

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All peer communications are encrypted
- **Content Verification**: Ensures integrity of downloaded content
- **Rotating Identifiers**: Periodically rotates user identifiers for enhanced privacy
- **Zero-Knowledge Verification**: Verify content without revealing what's being accessed
- **Plausible Deniability**: Technical measures ensure users can't determine exactly what others are sharing
